# OutfitPicker

Outfit Picker is an android app that matches your current clothes and gives you suggestions of what to wear, 

saving you time and struggle every morning. After taking pics of your wardrobe, this smart app will show you

combinations of outfits to save you time deciding. With a Tinder-like feature, it takes into account your fashion 

preference by letting you swipe left and right to decide your fashion style of the day. The closet gallery feature 

also allows you to quickly view all your clothing in your wardrobe, sorted by categories. Soon, Outfit Picker will 

become an essential part of your everyday life!

What Are We Proud Of - The nice UI and UX, especially the neat design and functionality of the closet gallery and 

the tinder selection page. - Sorting the items in the gallery by tags is a very useful feature.

Difficulties Encountered - Setting up http requests for android app was particularly painful, taking a huge chunk 

of our time. - Setting up the backend was an interesting challenge as none of us have much experience with that.

Future Features - User logins - Implement a share feature to let users share their outfit - Use machine learning to 

get insights from users fashion choice - Monetization of the app by letting brand sponsor outfit (ad)
